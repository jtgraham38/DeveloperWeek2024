## About the Project

Our project is a Laravel based app that automates the process of creating a rest api to facilitate interaction with a database.

- Takes information about the database, schema, and structure of the database.
- Support for multiple types of database, including MySQL and SQLite.
- Multiple API output types slated for future release.  Flask APIs currenlty supported.
- A deployment script is planned to automate the creation of apis further.
- Download a complete api and run it on your server to interact with your database through your apps.
- No coding required in the creation of your api.

This app is a novel attempt to automate what is normally a very repetitive, tedious task: the creation of a REST API.
